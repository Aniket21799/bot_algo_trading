# algo_trading_bot
This Algo Trading Bot is a software program that uses Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, along with basic machine learning algorithms and a Broker's API to execute trading decisions automatically. The Bot can make trading decisions based on the analysis of historical data, current market trends, and a set of predefined trading strategies.

The following are the main features of this Algo Trading Bot:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: The Bot collects historical data from the Broker's API and preprocesses it using NumPy and Pandas libraries. The data is then cleaned, formatted, and transformed into a format that can be used by the Machine Learning algorithms.

Machine Learning Algorithms: The Bot uses basic Machine Learning algorithms such as Linear Regression and Moving Average to identify patterns and trends in the data. These algorithms help the Bot make informed trading decisions based on historical and current market data.

Trading Strategies: The Bot has a set of predefined trading strategies that it uses to make trading decisions. These strategies are based on technical analysis indicators such as Moving Averages, Mean Reversion and Bollinger Bands. The Bot can also be customized to use other trading strategies based on the user's preferences.

Trading Execution: Once the Bot has made a trading decision, it executes the trade automatically using the Broker's API. The Bot can be programmed to enter and exit trades based on predefined conditions such as profit targets, stop losses, and risk management.

Performance Monitoring: The Bot keeps track of its performance using Matplotlib library to visualize the portfolio performance, P&L, and other trading metrics. The Bot can be customized to generate reports and alerts based on the user's preferences.
